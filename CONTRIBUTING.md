## Contributing Guidelines

- Get in touch and communicate! Let us know what you are working on or report bugs using the issues tab. Join the [Wesnoth Discord server](https://discord.gg/battleforwesnoth) to discuss the project live or to get in touch with the community. Ping @Vultraz to get access to the #project-haldric channel.
- A rough outline of things that need to be done can be found [here](https://github.com/wesnoth/haldric/issues/5).
- For code, we follow the [GDScript Style Guide](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/g ... guide.html). We try to write clean and self-documenting GDScript as it helps us build upon each other's work. We use static typing to write more robust code and get full auto completion in Godot 3.1. Also, we're here to review and to help you improve your code.
- The maintainers may refactor or tweak your code to make it fit the project's style, but we'll give you the opportunity to refine the style by yourself.
